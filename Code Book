# Code Book
This code book describes the variables used in run_analysisd.R which performs data cleanup.
Here are the variables (in alphabetical order):
1) activity_labels = data frame for "activity_labels.txt"
2) all_data = the combination of all training and test datasets, including all relevant labels
3) all_data2 = represents tidy dataset, derived from "all_data"  
4) data_activity = combines training and test datasets of "activity" dataset
5) data_combined = combines "subject" and "activity"
6) data_features = combines training and test datasets of "features" dataset
7) data_features_names = data frame for "features.txt" 
8) data_subject = combines training and test datasets of "subject" dataset
9) extract_features_names = extracted feature names with mean() and std()
10) select_features_names = selected features names from "extract_features_names"
11) subject_test = data frame for "subject_test.txt"
12) subject_train = data frame for "subject_train.txt"
13) x_test = data frame for "x_test.txt"
14) x_train = data frame for "x_train.txt"
15) y_test = data frame for "y_test.txt"
16) y_train = data frame for "y_train.txt"
